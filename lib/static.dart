        'Rented two bikes for a day and honestly it was a really good experience. Bikes are well maintained. I had rented Apache RTR 160 and my friend rented a Meteor 350 and had to say being an outsider riding in Kolkata is a task but it felt good. The owner is very very good, he also helps me to decide the right path to go to my destination.'

        'Hi, I rented 1 scooty for 2 whole days, and my experience was beyond expectations. The scooty was in good condition, the price is reasonable, location is also easily accessible, they provide 2 helmets with 1 scooty. The staff and owner were also good, responsive and friendly. They even helped us amidst the cyclone when I visited. Overall, a great experience and would very likely suggest this.'

        'I stay in Bangalore, but whenever I come to Kolkata, the first thing I do is to call them and rent a bike. All the bikes and scooty are in very good condition. But I mainly took Royal Enfield. During this Puja, I rented for 10 days. They also have pickup and drop service at your doorstep. The owner is really very polite and a good person to deal with. Definitely, I\'ll take the service whenever I\'m in Kolkata.'

        'Took a Royal Enfield Classic here for 13 days. Always wanted to drive it, but in Russia, this brand is not popular. Enjoyed riding it very much, though I needed a few days to get used to it and Kolkata traffic. I recommend this company to everyone who is looking to rent a motorcycle as they have transparent prices, no hidden costs, they are pleasant to deal with, and fast to respond.'
